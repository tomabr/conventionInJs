# Convention Programming in Java Script 

JavaScript gives possbility to write the same code in a various concepts.

First it is important to remember it is a prototype language, which is object-oriented language, not class-oriented language.
We can only simulate class.

Two main concept of writing code created two different style of writing code.
* **OOP (object oriented programming)**
* **OLOO (object linked to other objects)**

___
OOP is based on invoking function as constructor (with new operand). It is classic and prototype style of object oriented programming. With the new ES2015 we also uses new syntax based on class, but it is only a trick. The complilator uses still prototypes.
OLOO is modern style, based on delegation (the link between objects)

___

We can also write code in a chainable way, which give possibility to create a chainable of invoking function on the object.

## Examples

1. [OOP](index2.html)
2. [chainable OOP] (index3.html)

3. [OLOO](index4.html)
4. [chianable OLOO](index5.html)

6. [ES2015](index6.html)
